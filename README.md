**Objectives**:	Data privacy is an utmost concern in many industries. For this project, we particularly focused on the risks of data breach and and unwanted violations of data privacy policies that may occur in the airlines industry. To tackle this, we proposed  the usage of synthetic data to replicate the real airlines data as much as possible to retain data trends and relationships. 

**Methodology**: Implemented various generative models such as Copula, Copula-GAN, CT-GAN, VAE and Diffusion models to generate and encrypt a real-life airlines dataset. How well the generated data compared to the real data was measured with with similarity and quality scores with respect to the original data as well as strength of performance in ML models with resepct to the original data. 

**Results**: Similarity and quality scores of over 90% with ML performance retained at over 90% as well.
